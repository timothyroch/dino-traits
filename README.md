# Dino-Traits

A collaborative, open-source knowledge base for reconstructing dinosaur traits using comparative genomics and synthetic biology.

- **Goal:** Map ancient dinosaur features (e.g., teeth, tail, scales, claws, vocal organs) to extant gene candidates and modern engineering strategies.
- **Audience:** Synthetic biologists, evolutionary biologists, software engineers, DIY-bio, and de-extinction enthusiasts.
